I burn the onions on purpose. The smoke alarm gets there before he does.
“Was that necessary?” he asks, fanning the detector with a magazine from 2018.
“Yes,” I say. “I needed a siren.”

He leans on the counter, the cheap laminate flexing under his palm. “Which emergency are we pretending this time?”
“The one where I’m not sad,” I say. “It has a catchy theme song.”

He studies me the way people read warning labels. “You quit the art store,” he says, not a question. “You loved that place.”
“I loved the discount on sketchbooks,” I say. “I loved the part where I could pretend paper fixed things.”

He reaches for the pot and takes over the stirring like he’s defusing a bomb. “You could’ve told me before you sent the email.”
“I could’ve,” I say, and then I don’t say the rest: that the last time I told him first, he talked me back from the ledge and I’m trying to learn to walk the railing myself.

The soup calms down. The alarm does, too. He slides me the spoon. “Taste.”
It’s bitter. “Needs sugar,” I say.
He pulls a honey bear from the cabinet like a magician revealing a very tired rabbit.
“Don’t make a joke,” I warn.
“I wasn’t,” he says, and for once he isn’t. “I was going to ask if you wanted to start over.”

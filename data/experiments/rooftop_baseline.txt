She tells a joke about the elevator being broken and laughs. He laughs, too. They both smile in a way that feels like the script demanded it. The air is cold. Their hearts pound. She says she doesn't know what to say. He says he doesn't know either. They both sigh.

They repeat themselves. The conversation circles: are we friends, are we not, we should talk, we should not. The rooftop feels like a stage. He smirks. She smirks back. A single tear threatens. Nothing actually changes.

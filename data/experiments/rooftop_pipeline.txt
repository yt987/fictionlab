“So you dragged me up twelve flights to tell me you hate cardio,” Arra said, wind needling her cheeks. “Bold.”
“Cardio I can handle,” Yohana said. “Feelings, less so.”

Arra tipped her head. “Then say the non-feelings version.”
Yohana jammed her hands into her jacket. “I like what we are when no one’s watching. I don’t like what we pretend to be when they are.”

The vent rattled. Far below, the city hissed. Arra’s mouth twitched. “You practice that in the stairwell?”
“Three floors,” Yohana admitted. “Four if you count the part where I almost bailed.”

“Don’t,” Arra said, and the word came out too fast. She stepped closer, close enough to count the freckles Yohana pretended she didn’t have. “If we’re not friends, pick a better word.”

Yohana breathed a laugh. “Fine. Co-conspirators.”
“Romantic,” Arra said dryly. “Do we get matching crimes?”

Yohana reached into her pocket, pulled out a crumpled movie stub. “I didn’t go alone.”
Arra blinked. “You hate horror.”
“I do,” Yohana said. “But you like it. And I’m trying this new thing where I stop flinching before anything actually happens.”

Arra, betrayer of calm, smiled. “There it is.” She held up the stub between two fingers. “Evidence.”
“Of what?”
“That you’re braver than me,” Arra said, and kissed her like the city couldn’t be bothered to look up.

The server room hums. An alarm blinks red. Someone says, “We need to fix it,” and someone else says, “Check the logs.” They refresh dashboards and say they see errors. They talk about restarting the service, and then they talk about it again. The screen shows 500s. The team feels stressed but determined. One of them says, “I don’t know,” and another says, “Same.” The solution, when it arrives, is vague. They resolve to “do better next time.”

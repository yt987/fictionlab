02:14. Pager. The on-call toggles into VPN, wakes the laptop, and tails the edge logs.
“Traffic?” asks the incident commander, already opening the status page.
“Spiking 502s at the CDN,” the on-call says. “Origin health checks failing.”

They pin a window: CPU pinned on cache-02, evictions spiking. A rolling restart clears the metric for twelve seconds, then the graph cliffs again.

“Feature flags in the last hour?” the scribe asks.
A diff pops up: an innocuous performance tweak shipped with a hidden footgun—TTL from 300s to 1s for a single keyspace. Cache stampede, all the way down.

“Revert the flag,” says the commander. “And set stale-while-revalidate on the hot paths.”
“Reverting… shipped. SWR enabled. Give it thirty.”

The line of red in the dashboard thins to pink, then threads back to green. The war room chat exhales.

“Add an alert on TTL deltas,” the on-call says, already writing the postmortem. “And canary cache with a shadow pool.”
“Also a chaos test for stampede,” someone adds. The commander sets owners and dates. By 02:41, the pager is quiet enough to hear the fans again.
